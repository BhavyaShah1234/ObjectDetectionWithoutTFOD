# ObjectDetectionWithoutTFOD
This is my first and possibly most successful object detection(without classification) script until now. This is created using Tensorflow (without using TFOD API). Everything including the preprocessing, model creation, post processing and evaluation is done from scratch. The code is super easy to understand and duplicate. The annotated dataset can be found on kaggle.

The link to the code is as follows: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TCE2UZ0buwesGbkh2dhlUEiMfLnR8F88?usp=sharing

Some issues regarding accuracy and predictions persist.

The images and bounding boxes are plotted without Non Max Suppression(NMS). Final results will be published with NMS.
